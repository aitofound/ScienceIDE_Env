# Upstream test: code/meep/tests/aniso_disp.cpp. It fills a single-pixel
# Bloch-periodic 3D cell at resolution 200 with a fully anisotropic Lorentzian
# medium, drives it at a fixed wavevector, records eighty thousand samples of
# the field at the pixel and runs harminv on that history to extract the
# complex resonance frequency, which it compares against a dispersion relation
# solved analytically. Upstream only the pass or fail survives;
# ic/*/source.patch emits the recorded history itself, subsampled, together
# with the extracted frequency, at %0.17g, and pins both stepping loops. The
# upstream comparison is left in place.

# This check has no window or resolution knob. Both windows are pinned to step
# counts inside the patch (see ic/nominal/source.patch) so that the graded values
# come from the same number of steps in both initial conditions, and the second
# window is what the frequency resolution of the harminv extraction depends on.
# The whole thing runs in about one second. SAB_BUILD_JOBS affects the build only.
