# Upstream test: code/meep/tests/three_d.cpp. It steps a 3D cell over fourteen
# configurations: metal walls in vacuum over six chunk splittings,
# Bloch-periodic through a concentric-ring dielectric over five, a PML quality
# run on a single grid, and PML with chunk splitting over two. Upstream it
# asserts that each pair agrees and that the PML run decays; ic/*/source.patch
# adds instrumentation that emits the sampled field components and the three
# energies of every simulation at %0.17g, so the decomposition is graded as
# numbers rather than only as an assertion, and pins each stepping loop to the
# step count the upstream wall-clock condition takes at this resolution. The
# upstream comparisons are left in place and still abort the run if they fail.
# The file's two remaining cases, a 1D-cell Bloch regression and a PML
# auxiliary-field allocation regression, assert nothing numerical and are run
# but not graded.

# This check exposes no runtime knob: the graded values have to come from the
# window described in rubric.json "knobs", so there is nothing to scale without
# changing what is graded. SAB_BUILD_JOBS is a build-only setting and is printed
# as such, not as a knob, because build time is outside the suite budget.

# runs in about two seconds. SAB_BUILD_JOBS affects the build only, and build
# time is outside the suite budget.
