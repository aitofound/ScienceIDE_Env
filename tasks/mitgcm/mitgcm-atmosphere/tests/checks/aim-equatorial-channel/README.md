# aim-equatorial-channel

Upstream test: `code/mitgcm/verification/aim.5l_Equatorial_Channel/input`. Policy: `pointwise`.

## The test

AIM v23 physics in a walled equatorial channel with an analytic warm-pool SST. `run.sh` builds one MITgcm executable for this
configuration with the tree's own `tools/genmake2` (the build configuration
under `mods/`: `SIZE.h`, `packages.conf` and the option headers of the
upstream experiment, gfortran optfile `linux_amd64_gfortran`, one process,
tiles only), then runs it on the deck under `ic/<ic>/`. Configuration:
verification/aim.5l_Equatorial_Channel/input: the SPEEDY v23 physics (pkg/aim_v23) on a spherical-polar equatorial CHANNEL of 128x23 points at 2.8125 degrees from 32.34S to 32.34N with 5 pressure levels, carried as 4 tiles of 32x23 on one process (2944 physics columns, the smallest AIM deck in the tree), closed by solid walls at the two channel edges by the experiment's own code/ini_depths.F, which sets Ro_surf=rF(Nr+1) wherever |yC| >= |ygOrigin|; the distinguishing feature is that BOTH standard AIM surface-boundary paths are switched off (aim_useFMsurfBC=.FALSE. and aim_useMMsurfFc=.FALSE. in data.aimphys) and the experiment's own code/aim_surf_bc.F supplies the surface state analytically - a Gaussian warm pool sst1 = 280 + 20*exp(-((x-xBump)/dxBump)^2 - ((y-yBump)/dyBump)^2) with land and ice surface temperatures set equal to it and the year fraction FROZEN at tYear = 0.25 - 10/365, so the insolation pattern does not move; there is no land package and no sea ice, the dynamics is vector-invariant-free (flux-form momentum, vectorInvariantMomentum unset) with staggerTimeStep, exactConserv, a linear implicit free surface, rotationPeriod=86400., gravity=9.81, rhoConst=1.0, third-order humidity advection (saltAdvScheme=3), tracForcingOutAB=1, cg2d on cg2dTargetResWunit=5.E-16, and pkg/shap_filt with Shap_funct=2, nShapT=4, nShapUV=4, Shap_Trtau=5400., Shap_uvtau=1800. and Shap_noSlip=1. for the channel walls; restarted from the deck's pickup at iteration 51840 (one model year at 600 s steps) and run the deck's own 10 steps of 600 s (100 minutes), the full upstream window..

The production path it forces: pkg/aim_v23's phy_driver.F over 2944 columns every step - phy_shtorh.F, the mass-flux convection phy_convmf.F (which in this deck is genuinely active because the analytic warm pool keeps a deep moist column over the bump), phy_lscond.F, SOL_OZ/RADSW and the four-band RADLW in phy_radiat.F, the surface-flux chain phy_suflux_prep/ocean/land/post.F and phy_vdifsc.F; the experiment's own aim_surf_bc.F evaluating the analytic SST every step for every column; mom_fluxform.F; gad_advection with saltAdvScheme=3 for humidity; shap_filt_uv_s2.F/shap_filt_tracer_s2.F with Shap_noSlip at the walls; and cg2d_solver.F on a 2944-point surface..

Runtime knobs (`run.sh --help`): `SAB_STEPS` (default 10, the graded
value; the upstream deck runs 10 steps of 600 s) scales the
run linearly, and `SAB_BUILD_JOBS` (default 4) only the build. Expected run
time on the declared resources, build excluded: about 3 s;
the per-check build (roughly 40 s on an x86_64 host) is reported by `run.sh`
as `SAB_BUILD_SECONDS` and does not count against the suite budget.

## The two initial conditions

`ic/nominal` is the upstream deck, assembled as `testreport` assembles it
(the experiment's `input/`),
with these deck edits: `nTimeSteps` set to the graded window, `dumpFreq`,
`pChkptFreq` and `chkptFreq` set to zero and `dumpInitAndLast=.TRUE.` so that the only
state written is the initial and final dump, and
`writeBinaryPrec=64` so the dump is double precision and `useSingleCpuIO=.TRUE.` so the dump is one global file per field rather than one per tile.

`ic/variant` holds only the deck files that differ, laid over `ic/nominal` by
`run.sh`; the difference is `ABLWV1=0.7000000000000002` in `data.aimphys` instead of 0.7:
two ulps of the graded precision (binary64) on a parameter that enters the
tendency from the first step, a distinct double, so the two runs differ at
round-off level from the first step. The
spread between them is the check's measured sensitivity under the pass policy
and must stay inside the bound.

## The pass policy

Every cell of every prognostic field in the final state dump must satisfy
|candidate - reference| <= 1e-10 + 1e-08 |reference|.
The relative part is the working bound because the fields span many orders of
magnitude; the absolute part covers cells at or near zero. The observable is the full final state dump compared pointwise, the graded set is exactly U, V, W, T, S, Eta, PH because pkg/diagnostics is not compiled into this experiment at all (packages.conf lists only 'atmospheric' and 'aim_v23'), and the round-off floor is set by cg2d, which stops on cg2dTargetResWunit=5.E-16, essentially machine precision per unit weight, so an iteration-count difference moves Eta at about 1e-15. The switch argument is the familiar AIM one - phy_convmf.F, phy_lscond.F and phy_vdifsc.F each gate on a threshold and a round-off perturbation could in principle flip one - but it is WEAKER here than in any other AIM check simply because the deck is the smallest: about 1.5e4 column-level tests per step instead of 3e4 or 4e4, so with a nominal-versus-variant difference of order 1e-13 after ten steps the expected number of coincidences over the window is correspondingly smaller. Two further properties help: the year fraction is frozen in the experiment's aim_surf_bc.F, so the insolation and the prescribed surface temperature are exactly constant in time and contribute no time-dependent trigger, and the channel spans only the tropics, so there is no polar night and every column is daylit throughout. The variant perturbs ABLWV1, the longwave absorptivity of water vapour in the weak H2O band, whose base value 0.7 is the package default set in pkg/aim_v23/phy_const.h and applied by INPHYS before AIM_READPARMS reads the present-but-empty AIM_PAR_RAD group of data.aimphys; RADLW forms TAU2(J,K,3)=EXP(-DELTAP*ABLWV1*QA(J,K)) and QA is nonzero everywhere in this deck because the state comes from a one-year pickup, so unlike the from-rest thSI deck the perturbation reaches every column with water vapour on the very first step.
Faults: The AIM physics faults are the same as in the other two AIM checks and are all decades above a round-off bound: a dropped longwave band or a mis-set absorptivity in RADLW changes T by parts in 1e-4 over the window; a cheapened mass-flux closure in phy_convmf.F changes T and q in the convecting columns over the warm pool by parts in 1e-3 within one step; dropping the stability correction or the gustiness term in phy_suflux_prep.F/phy_suflux_ocean.F changes the surface fluxes by several W/m2 and the lowest-level T by parts in 1e-5 per step. What this check adds is the CHANNEL geometry: getting the no-slip wall treatment wrong in the Shapiro filter (Shap_noSlip=1.) or mis-masking the flux-form momentum tendency at the closed northern and southern boundaries in mom_fluxform.F changes U along the wall rows by order one and, through the pressure solve, the interior Eta by parts in 1e-6 within the window. A single-precision physics column shows at parts in 1e-7 on the first step.

## Evidence

ADDED UNDER THE ADDENDUM (this deck was excluded in the earlier version of this spec as 'a third AIM deck'; the addendum removes 'duplicates another deck' as a reason). STALE PICKUP META, THE MOST SURPRISING THING IN THIS DECK: input/pickup.0000051840.meta declares dimList = [64,1,64 / 23,1,23], i.e. a 64x23 global grid, but code/SIZE.h gives sNx=32, nSx=4, Nx=128 and the file is 1436672 bytes = 61 records x 2944 doubles = 61 x (128x23). The meta's dimList is simply wrong upstream; MDS_READ_FIELD reads records at the model's global dimensions and uses the meta only for precision (float64) and the field list, so the run is correct - but do NOT 'fix' the meta and do not let any tooling validate the pickup against it. THE EXPERIMENT'S code/ini_depths.F IS A STALE COPY of model/src/ini_depths.F: it still tests debugLevel where the current source tests plotLevel and it is missing the _EXCH_XY_RS(topoZ) call that upstream added; its only intentional change is un-commenting the two blocks that close the domain at |yC| >= |ygOrigin|. That means a future upstream change to ini_depths.F will silently not reach this deck, which is a property of the experiment, not a fault of the check, but a reviewer should know it. code/aim_surf_bc.F writes aim_SST.0000051840.data via AIM_WRITE_PHYS at myIter==nIter0 only; the final iteration is 51850, so it cannot collide with the '*.<final iteration>.data' collection glob, but the file will be present in the run directory. data.pkg enables only useAIM and useSHAP_FILT: no diagnostics, no MNC, no land, no thsice, so nothing but the state dump is written and aim_diagFreq defaults to dumpFreq, which the generator sets to zero. pickupStrictlyMatch=.FALSE., so a pickup-versus-package mismatch warns instead of aborting - read the log rather than trusting a clean exit. readBinaryPrec=64 and writeBinaryPrec=64 are both set explicitly. S here is specific humidity and is fully prognostic, so nothing is excluded from grading. Window is the deck's own 10 steps and must not be raised without re-measuring: a spun-up moist tropical channel with an active warm pool is chaotic over days.

Floor: the optimised gfortran build and the IEEE -O0 build of the same source, run natively on the x86_64 host on 2026-09-02, differ on this deck by at most 2.2e-11 in absolute terms, 6.9e-03 of the bound (in PH); the two builds pass each other under the rule. Faults, same build with one parameter changed: the cg2d target residual loosened to 1e-3 uses 0.0e+00 of the bound (NO EFFECT (no cg2d in this configuration)), and the variant parameter off by five percent 1.9e+08 of the bound (FAIL). Measured run time of the nominal deck, build excluded: 0.1 s natively.
