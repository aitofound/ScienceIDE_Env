# held-suarez-rstar-20l

Upstream test: `code/mitgcm/verification/tutorial_held_suarez_cs/input`. Policy: `pointwise`.

## The test

Held-Suarez with the rStar nonlinear free surface, 20 levels. `run.sh` builds one MITgcm executable for this
configuration with the tree's own `tools/genmake2` (the build configuration
under `mods/`: `SIZE.h`, `packages.conf` and the option headers of the
upstream experiment, gfortran optfile `linux_amd64_gfortran`, one process,
tiles only), then runs it on the deck under `ic/<ic>/`. Configuration:
verification/tutorial_held_suarez_cs/input: the same Held-Suarez forcing as the 5-level deck but on 20 pressure levels of 50 hPa each, on the 32x32x6 cubed sphere as 6 tiles of 32x32 with exch2, and with the free surface treated nonlinearly: nonlinFreeSurf=4 with select_rStar=2, exactConserv=.TRUE., hFacInf=0.2/hFacSup=2.0 and uniformLin_PhiSurf=.FALSE., so the vertical coordinate is rescaled every step (calc_r_star.F, update_surf_dr.F, update_r_star.F) instead of being frozen; momViscosity is off and pkg/shap_filt with nShapUV=4 and nShapUVPhys=4 is again the only momentum dissipation, cg2d converges on cg2dTargetResWunit=8.E-16, the grid comes from the packed grid_cs32.face00N.bin files in the deck, and saltStepping is off; restarted from the deck's own spun-up pickup at iteration 276480 (startTime=124416000., four years in) and run the deck's own 16 steps of 450 s (2 h of model time), the upstream short-test window, kept at that length because a spun-up Held-Suarez state is fully chaotic and only a window of hours stays pointwise..

The production path it forces: The rStar machinery in model/src (calc_r_star.F, update_surf_dr.F, update_r_star.F, integr_continuity.F with exactConserv) run over 20 levels and 6144 columns each step; mom_vecinv.F and the Shapiro filter shap_filt_uv_s2.F applied to a 20-level state, which quadruples the per-step filter and exchange cost relative to held-suarez-cs; calc_phi_hyd.F integrating the ideal-gas geopotential through 20 levels; and cg2d_solver.F..

Runtime knobs (`run.sh --help`): `SAB_STEPS` (default 16, the graded
value; the upstream deck runs 16 steps of 450 s) scales the
run linearly, and `SAB_BUILD_JOBS` (default 4) only the build. Expected run
time on the declared resources, build excluded: about 3 s;
the per-check build (roughly 40 s on an x86_64 host) is reported by `run.sh`
as `SAB_BUILD_SECONDS` and does not count against the suite budget.

## The two initial conditions

`ic/nominal` is the upstream deck, assembled as `testreport` assembles it
(the experiment's `input/`),
with these deck edits: `nTimeSteps` set to the graded window, `dumpFreq`,
`pChkptFreq` and `chkptFreq` set to zero and `dumpInitAndLast=.TRUE.` so that the only
state written is the initial and final dump, and
`writeBinaryPrec=64` so the dump is double precision and `useSingleCpuIO=.TRUE.` so the dump is one global file per field rather than one per tile.

`ic/variant` holds only the deck files that differ, laid over `ic/nominal` by
`run.sh`; the difference is `rotationPeriod=86400.00000000003` in `data` instead of 86400:
two ulps of the graded precision (binary64) on a parameter that enters the
tendency from the first step, a distinct double, so the two runs differ at
round-off level from the first step. The
spread between them is the check's measured sensitivity under the pass policy
and must stay inside the bound.

## The pass policy

Every cell of every prognostic field in the final state dump must satisfy
|candidate - reference| <= 1e-10 + 1e-08 |reference|; the fields `S` are not graded.
The relative part is the working bound because the fields span many orders of
magnitude; the absolute part covers cells at or near zero. The bound is a pointwise round-off bound and it is physical here because everything in the loop is a smooth algebraic function of the state: the rStar rescaling divides by column thicknesses that are bounded away from zero on this flat-bottomed aquaplanet (hFacInf=0.2, hFacSup=2.0 are never approached, the surface pressure moves by a few per mille), the Shapiro filter is a fixed stencil with no limiter, and the Held-Suarez forcing is a Newtonian relaxation whose only branch is the fixed sigma_b=0.7 boundary, which on a 20-level uniform grid falls strictly between level interfaces. The round-off floor is set by cg2d, which stops on cg2dTargetResWunit=8.E-16, i.e. essentially at machine precision per unit weight, so the two runs' surface-pressure solves agree to the last bits and a differing iteration count perturbs Eta at about 1e-15, not at the tolerance. The window is short on purpose and is the deck's own upstream short test: the state is a four-year spin-up of a chaotic dry atmosphere, so over weeks a one-ulp perturbation grows to order one, but over 16 steps (2 hours) it stays at the round-off floor; it is not safe to lengthen this window without re-measuring. The variant perturbs rotationPeriod, which the deck sets explicitly to 86400. in PARM01 and from which ini_parms.F computes omega = 2*pi/rotationPeriod; that enters the Coriolis parameter at every point of the grid and therefore the momentum tendency on the very first step, everywhere at once, which is exactly the sensitivity the pass policy is meant to sit above.
Faults: A fault in the rStar rescaling (forgetting the rStarFacC factor in one of the tendency terms, dropping the exactConserv correction to the vertical velocity in integr_continuity.F, or updating hFac from the wrong Eta) moves W and PH by parts in 1e-4 within a few steps and Eta by parts in 1e-6, because the rescaling factors sit within a few percent of one and every term that carries them is O(1). Mis-integrating the geopotential in calc_phi_hyd.F for integr_GeoPot on 20 levels shifts PH by parts in 1e-3. Dropping the Coriolis metric term or evaluating omega from the sidereal default (86164 s) instead of the deck's 86400 s changes U and V by parts in 1e-3 within one step. A single-precision state shows at parts in 1e-7.

## Evidence

The deck restarts from pickup.0000276480 (with .meta), which must be copied; it sets startTime=124416000. rather than nIter0, and MITgcm derives nIter0 = startTime/deltaT = 276480, so the final dump is at iteration 276496 and the generator must not assume an nIter0 line exists. The deck's data has a commented '#nTimeSteps=69120,' line ABOVE the active 'nTimeSteps=16,'; a regex that rewrites the first line matching '^\s*nTimeSteps' is safe because the commented one starts with '#', but a looser match would silently rewrite the comment and leave the real window at 16. packages.conf lists mnc, but data.pkg has useMNC commented out and genmake2 drops mnc from the package list when no NetCDF library is found (tools/genmake2 turnOff_pkg path), so no extra edit and no NetCDF dependency. data.diagnostics streams all have frequency 86400., far outside the 7200 s window, so no diagnostics files are written. S is identically zero (saltStepping=.FALSE., sRef=20*0.0), hence not_graded. The window is 16 steps and must not be raised: Held-Suarez from a spun-up state is chaotic and the survey's own note about the 20-step sibling applies with more force here.

Floor: the optimised gfortran build and the IEEE -O0 build of the same source, run natively on the x86_64 host on 2026-09-02, differ on this deck by at most 8.7e-11 in absolute terms, 3.7e-03 of the bound (in PH); the two builds pass each other under the rule. Faults, same build with one parameter changed: the cg2d target residual loosened to 1e-3 uses 0.0e+00 of the bound (NO EFFECT (no cg2d in this configuration)), and the variant parameter off by five percent 9.6e+10 of the bound (FAIL). Measured run time of the nominal deck, build excluded: 3.0 s natively.
